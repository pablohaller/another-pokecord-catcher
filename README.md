# Another Pokecord Catcher

Allows to easily copy the catch command of Pokecord pokemons.

When opening a URL from pokecord (i.e.: [https://images.pokecord.xyz/regular/25.png](https://images.pokecord.xyz/regular/25.png)), the browser redirects to the application, showing the pokemon and it's catch command. This is possible by usingÂ [Redirector](https://einaregilsson.com/redirector/).
